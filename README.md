Agent Authorisation API
==============================

This API allows agents to request authorisation to act on a client's behalf for the different MTD tax services. The API also allows the Agent to check the status of authorisation request. Please note this API has no effect on the existing XML API. 

## Motivation
Agents often use software to perform services for their clients. 
The API will benefit these agents since it will allow them to be able to request the invitation link directly through software, to send to their client so that they can authorise the agent for a service. 
This will save an agent time since currently they must separately log into Agent Services UI to request this link. 
This also aligns with the API first strategy for Agent Services.

### API docs
Refer to [RAML documentation](https://github.com/hmrc/agent-authorisation-api/blob/master/resources/public/api/conf/0.0/application.raml) for further details on each API.
