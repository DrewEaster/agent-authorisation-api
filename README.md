Agent Client Authorisation API
==============================

An API allowing MTD-enabled Agents to request authorisation to a service for a client, instead of filling the 64-8 paper form.

## Motivation
Agents often use software to perform services for their clients. 
The API will benefit these agents since it will allow them to be able to request the invitation link to authorise an agent for a service directly through software. 
This will save an agent time since currently an agent must separately log into Agent Services to request this link. 
This also aligns with the API first strategy for Agent Services.

### API docs
Refer to [RAML documentation](https://github.com/hmrc/agent-client-authorisation-api/blob/master/resources/public/api/conf/0.1/application.raml) for further details on each API.
